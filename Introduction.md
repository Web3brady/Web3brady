Quai Beasts is an NFT collection of 1111 unique beasts on the Quai Network.

If we had to sum everything up in a few words, our focus is on community, exclusivity, alpha, and education.

The core values of Quai Beasts are honesty and transparency between founders and investors—an ideology often overlooked in this space.

Our goal is to build a tight-knit community of like-minded individuals passionate about the Quai ecosystem. A space where we share insights, strategies, and ideas while solidifying ourselves as one of the OG communities on Quai. We want to be a hub where both newcomers and experienced investors can learn, grow, and thrive together.

We are a group of traders with years of experience in the NFT and crypto space. We are not developers. We are not digital artists. We are not professional marketers. But we are builders, doing everything ourselves and learning along the way. Before Quai, most of us focused on SOL and ETH, gaining firsthand experience in navigating ecosystems, identifying quality projects, understanding founders, spotting red flags, and mastering marketing strategies. With Quai Beasts, we aim to apply this knowledge and collectively explore the Quai Network, gaining an early mover advantage.

We will consistently share valuable insights, market analysis, and educational content across our platforms, helping our holders navigate the NFT space with confidence. Expect alpha on Quai, SOL, and ETH, trading strategies, and opportunities that can give you an edge in the market.

This project is also a proof-of-concept for us—a stepping stone to even bigger things. We’re learning as we go, and while there will be challenges, there will also be valuable lessons and massive opportunities.
